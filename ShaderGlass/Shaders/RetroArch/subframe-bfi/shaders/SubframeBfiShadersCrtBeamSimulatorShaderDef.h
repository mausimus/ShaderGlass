//             The World's First Realtime Blur-Reducing CRT Simulator
//       Best for 60fps on 240-480Hz+ Displays, Still Works on 120Hz+ Displays
//                 Original Version 2022. Publicly Released 2024.
//
// CREDIT: Teamwork of Mark Rejhon @BlurBusters & Timothy Lottes @NOTimothyLottes
// Gamma corrected CRT simulator in a shader using clever formula-by-scanline trick
// (easily can generate LUTs, for other workflows like FPGAs or Javascript)
// - @NOTimothyLottes provided the algorithm for per-pixel BFI (Variable MPRT, higher MPRT for bright pixels)
// - @BlurBusters provided the algorithm for the CRT electron beam (2022, publicly released for first time)
//
// Contact Blur Busters for help integrating this in your product (emulator, fpga, filter, display firmware, video processor)
//
// This new algorithm has multiple breakthroughs:
//
// - Seamless; no banding*!  (*Monitor/OS configuration: SDR=on, HDR=off, ABL=off, APL=off, gamma=2.4)
// - Phosphor fadebehind simulation in rolling scan.
// - Works on LCDs and OLEDs.
// - Variable per-pixel MPRT. Spreads brighter pixels over more refresh cycles than dimmer pixels.
// - No image retention on LCDs or OLEDs.
// - No integer divisor requirement. Recommended but not necessary (e.g. 60fps 144Hz works!)
// - Gain adjustment (less motion blur at lower gain values, by trading off brightness)
// - Realtime (for retro & emulator uses) and slo-mo modes (educational)
// - Great for softer 60Hz motion blur reduction, less eyestrain than classic 60Hz BFI/strobe.
// - Algorithm can be ported to shader and/or emulator and/or FPGA and/or display firmware.
//
// For best real time CRT realism:
//
// - Reasonably fast performing GPU (many integrated GPUs are unable to keep up)
// - Fastest GtG pixel response (A settings-modified OLED looks good with this algorithm)
// - As much Hz per CRT Hz! (960Hz better than 480Hz better than 240Hz)
// - Integer divisors are still better (just not mandatory)
// - Brightest SDR display with linear response (no ABL, no APL), as HDR boost adds banding
//     (unless you can modify the firmware to make it linear brightness during a rolling scan)
//
// *** IMPORTANT ***
// *** DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS ***
//
// - Best for gaming LCD or OLED monitors with fast pixel response.
// - More Hz per simulated CRT Hz is better (240Hz, 480Hz simulates 60Hz tubes more accurately than 120Hz).
// - OLED (SDR mode) looks better than LCD, but still works on LCD
// - May have minor banding with very slow GtG, asymmetric-GtG (VA LCDs), or excessively-overdriven.
// - Designed for sample & hold displays with excess refresh rate (LCDs and OLEDs);
//     Not intended for use with strobed or impulsed displays. Please turn off your displays' BFI/strobing.
//     This is because we need 100% software control of the flicker algorithm to simulate a CRT beam.
//
// SDR MODE RECOMMENDED FOR NOW (Due to predictable gamma compensation math)
//
// - Best results occur on display configured to standard SDR gamma curve and ABL/APL disabled to go 100% bandfree
// - Please set your display gamma to 2.2 or 2.4, turn off ABL/APL in display settings, and set your OLED to SDR mode.
// - Will NOT work well with some FALD and MiniLED due to backlight lagbehind effects.
// - Need future API access to OLED ABL/ABL algorithm to compensate for OLED ABL/APL windowing interference with algorithm.
// - This code is heavily commented because of the complexity of the algorithm.

//------------------ Constants migrated to runtime params --------------------//
// Brightness-vs-motionblur tradeoff for bright pixel.
//   - Defacto simulates fast/slow phosphor.
//   - 1.0 is unchanged brightness (same as non-CRT, but no blur reduction for brightest pixels, only for dimmer pixels).
//   - 0.5 is half brightness spread over fewer frames (creates lower MPRT persistence for darker pixels).
//   - ~0.7 recommended for 240Hz+, ~0.5 recommended for 120Hz due to limited inHz:outHz ratio.
// Your display's gamma value. Necessary to prevent horizontal-bands artifacts.
// Reduced frame rate mode
//   - This can be helpful to see individual CRT-simulated frames better (educational!)
//   - 1.0 is framerate=Hz, 0.5 is framerate being half of Hz, 0.1 is framerate being 10% of real Hz.
//^^ Slow down or speed up the simulation

// Constants Definitions
// Play with the documented constants!
// - REALTIME: Use FRAMES_PER_HZ=4 for 240Hz and FRAMES_PER_HZ=8 for 480Hz, to simulate a 60Hz tube in realtime
// - SLOMO: Use crazy large FRAMES_PER_HZ numbers to watch a CRT tube like a slo-motion video. Try FRAMES_PER_HZ=100!
// - FRAMESTEP: Use low frame rates to inspect frames.  Try FRAMES_PER_HZ=8 and FPS_DIVISOR=0.02!
// All are floats (keep a .0 for integers)
// Ratio of native Hz per CRT Hz.  More native Hz per CRT Hz simulates CRT better.
//   - Use 4.0 for 60fps at 240Hz realtime.
//   - Use 2.4 for 60fps at 144Hz realtime.
//   - Use 2.75 for 60fps at 165Hz realtime.
//   - Use ~100 for super-slo-motion.
//   - Best to keep it integer divisor but not essential (works!)
//^^automating this to work with whatever the user's subframe setting is
// Splitscreen versus mode for comparing to non-CRT-simulated
// LCD SAVER SYSTEM
//   - Prevents image retention from BFI interfering with LCD voltage polarity inversion algorithm
//   - When LCD_ANTI_RETENTION is enabled:
//     - Automatically prevents FRAMES_PER_HZ from remaining an even integer by conditionally adding a slew float.
//     - FRAMES_PER_HZ 2 becomes 2.001, 4 becomes 4.001, and 6 becomes 6.001, etc.
//     - Scientific Reason: https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewtopic.php?t=7539 BFI interaction with LCD voltage polarity inversion
//     - Known Side effect: You've decoupled the CRT simulators' own VSYNC from the real displays' VSYNC.  But magically, there's no tearing artifacts :-)
//     - Not needed for OLEDs, safe to turn off, but should be ON by default to be foolproof.
//#define LCD_ANTI_RETENTION  true
//^^moved to runtime parameter
//#define LCD_INVERSION_COMPENSATION_SLEW 0.001
//^^moved to runtime parameter
// CRT SCAN DIRECTION. Can be useful to counteract an OS rotation of your display
//   - 1 default (top to bottom), recommended
//   - 2 reverse (bottom to top)
//   - 3 portrait (left to right)
//   - 4 reverse portrait (right to left)
//^^ compensate for RetroArch's weird approach to origin by reversing the scan
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Utility Macros
// Selection Function: Returns 'b' if 'p' is true, else 'a'.
// LCD SAVER (prevent image retention)
// Adds a slew to FRAMES_PER_HZ when ANTI_RETENTION is enabled and FRAMES_PER_HZ is an exact even integer.
// We support non-integer FRAMES_PER_HZ, so this is a magically convenient solution
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// sRGB Encoding and Decoding Functions, to gamma correct/uncorrect
// Encode linear color to sRGB. (applies gamma curve)
// Decode sRGB color to linear. (undoes gamma curve)
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Gets pixel from the unprocessed framebuffer.
//
// Placeholder for accessing the 3 trailing unprocessed frames (for simulating CRT on)
//   - Frame counter represents simulated CRT refresh cycle number.
//   - Always assign numbers to your refresh cycles. For reliability, keep a 3 frame trailing buffer.
//   - We index by frame counter because it is necessary for blending adjacent CRT refresh cycles,
//      for the phosphor fade algorithm on old frame at bottom, and new frames at top.
//   - Framebuffer to retrieve from should be unscaled (e.g. original game resolution or emulator resolution).
//   - (If you do optional additional processing such as scaling+scanlines+masks, do it post-processing after this stage)
// DEMO version:
//   - We cheat by horizontally shifting shifted pixel reads from a texture.
// PRODUCTION version:
//   - Put your own code to retrieve a pixel from your series of unprocessed frame buffers.
//     IMPORTANT: For integration into firmware/software/emulators/games, this must be executed
//     at refresh cycle granularity independently of your underlying games' framerate!
//     There are three independent frequencies involved:
//     - Native Hz (your actual physical display)
//     - Simulated CRT Hz (Hz of simulated CRT tube)
//     - Underlying content frame rate (this shader doesn't need to know; TODO: Unless you plan to simulate VRR-CRT)
//
// We simulate missing framebuffers (for accurate real world case)
// Continuous horizontal shift depending on hzCounter
//^^disabling this since we'll be providing our own blurry motion :)
// We'll offset uv.x by baseShift, and round-off to screen coordinates to avoid seam artifacts
// Sample texture with no mip (textureLod)
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CRT Rolling Scan Simulation With Phosphor Fade + Brightness Redistributor Algorithm
//
// New variable 'per-pixel MPRT' algorithm that mimics CRT phosphor decay too.
// - We emit as many photons as possible as early as possible, and if we can't emit it all (e.g. RGB 255)
//   then we continue emitting in the next refresh cycle until we've hit our target (gamma-compensated).
// - This is a clever trick to keep CRT simulation brighter but still benefit motion clarity of most colors.
//   Besides, real CRT tubes behave roughly similar too! (overexcited phosphor take longer to decay)
// - This also concurrently produces a phosphor-fade style behavior.
// - Win-win!
//
// Parameters:
// - c2: total brightness * framesPerHz per channel.
// - crtRasterPos: normalized raster position [0..1] representing current scan line
// - phaseOffset: fractional start of the brightness interval [0..1] (0.0 at top, 1.0 at bottom).
// - framesPerHz: Number of frames per Hz. (Does not have to be integer divisible!)
//
// Get pixels from three consecutive refresh cycles
// Compute "photon budgets" for all three cycles
// Process each color channel independently
// Get brightness lengths for all three cycles
// TODO: Optimize to use only 2 frames.
// Unfortunately I need all 3 right now because if I only do 2,
// I get artifacts at either top OR bottom edge (can't eliminate both)
// What I may do is use a phase offset (e.g. input framebuffer chain
// rotates forward in middle of emulated CRT Hz), as a workaround, and
// see if that solves the problem and reduces the queue to 2.
// (Will attempt later)
// Convert normalized values to frame space
// Define intervals for all three trailing refresh cycles
// Calculate overlaps for all three cycles
// Sum all overlaps for final brightness
// disable the effect if we don't have any subframes
// uv: Normalized coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (1,1) at the top-right.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CRT beam calculations
// Frame counter, which may be compensated by slo-mo modes (FPS_DIVISOR). Does not need to be integer divisible.
// Normalized raster position [0..1] representing current position of simulated CRT electron beam
// CRT refresh cycle counter
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Splitscreen processing
// crtTube: Boolean indicating whether the current pixel is within the CRT-BFI region.
// When splitscreen is off, apply CRT-BFI to entire screen
// Calculate border regions (in pixels)
// Border only exists in the non-BFI region (x > SPLITSCREEN_X || y > SPLITSCREEN_Y)
// We #ifdef the if statement away for shader efficiency (though this specific one didn't affect performance)
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Get CRT simulated version of pixel
// Brightness compensation for unprocessed pixels through similar gamma-curve (match gamma of simulated CRT)
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Credits Reminder:
// Please credit BLUR BUSTERS & TIMOTHY LOTTES if this algorithm is used in your project/product.
// Hundreds of hours of research was done on related work that led to this algorithm.
