///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// This shader generates the Screen Texture, which is effectively overlayed on top of the actual screen image in the
//  RGBToCRT shader. This includes the emulation of the shadow mask (or slot mask, aperture grill) of a CRT screen, as
//  well as masking around the edges to handle blacking out values that are outside of the visible screen.
// Do a barrel distortion to a given texture coordinate to emulate a curved CRT screen.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// This file contains all the stuff used to make these shaders compile both as GLSL and HLSL.
//
// Note that one of GLSL or HLSL must be defined.
// Decfine this to make my syntax highlighting less angry
// GLSL doesn't have separate samplers and textures, so we're using texName for everything
// A simple approximation of atan2 will suffice here, just a few terms of the taylor series are good enough for the
//  angle ranges we're dealing with.
// The original texture coordinate, intended to come straight from the full-render-target quad, in [-1..1] range (not
//  standard [0..1])
// a [horizontal, vertical] distortion pair which describes the effective curvature of the virtual screen.
// We don't want to let the distortion drop below this minimum value because at 0, the whole technique falls apart.
// $TODO: It's definitely possible to handle distortion.x or y == 0 as a special case, but I didn't do it for now.
// We're going to cast a ray from a virtual camera position p0 (0, 0, -k_distance) and collide it with a unit sphere.
//  The horizontal and vertical spread of the rays is determined by the distortion values.
// Get the squared length of the ray.
// we have an originating point p0 and a ray direction, so we can treat that as a parametric equation:
//  p = p0 + r*t
// Since we have a non-translated unit sphere (1 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2) we can sub in our parametric values and solve for
//  t as a quadratic. To simplify the math, we're going to use a slightly different form of quadratic equation:
//  t^2 - 2b*t + c == 0
// Given our "t^2 - 2b*t + c == 0" quadratic form, the quadratic formula simplifies to -b +/- sqrt(b^2 - c).
// Get the nearer of the two coordinates (and do a max inside the sqrt so we still get continuous values outside of
//  the sphere, even if they're nonsensical, they'll get masked out by our mask value anyway).
// Get our uv coordinates (Basically, latitude and longitude).
// maxUV could be calculated on the CPU and passed in for perf.
// Do the same calculation as above, but for two additional rays: the x, 0, z ray pointing all the way to the right,
//  and the 0, y, z ray pointing at the bottom (Both rays are packed into the same "diagonal" ray value, but the
//  lengths are calculated separately). This gets us the uv extents for the rays that we cast, which we can use to
//  scale our output UVs.
// Scale our UVs by the max value.
// The mask texture for the CRT. That is, if you think of an old CRT and how you could see the
//  R, G, and B dots, this is that texture. Needs to be set up to wrap, as well as to have mip mapping (and, ideally,
//  anisotropic filtering too, if rendering as a curved screen, to help with sharpness and aliasing).
//DECLARE_TEXTURE2D(g_maskTexture, g_sampler);
// This is a 64-tap poisson disc filter, found here:
//  https://www.geeks3d.com/20100628/3d-programming-ready-to-use-64-sample-poisson-disc/
// $NOTE: The first four values here are the same as the first four in RGBToCRT.hlsl, and are expected to match.
// This shader is intended to render a screen of the correct shape regardless of the output render target shape,
//  effectively letterboxing or pillarboxing as needed(i.e. rendering a 4:3 screen to a 16:9 render target).
//  g_viewScale is the scale value necessary to get the resulting screen scale correct. In the event the output
//  render target is wider than the intended screen, the screen needs to be scaled down horizontally to pillarbox,
//  usually like (where screenAspectRatio is crtScreenWidth / crtScreenHeight):
//    (x: (renderTargetWidth / renderTargetHeight) * (1.0 / screenAspectRatio), y: 1.0)
//  if the output render target is taller than the intended screen, it will end up letterboxed using something like:
//    (x: 1.0, y: (renderTargetHeight / renderTargetWidth) * screenAspectRatio)
// Note that if overscan (where the edges of the screen cover up some of the picture) is being emulated, it
//  potentially needs to be taken into account in this value too. See RGBToCRT.h for details if that's the case.
// If overscan emulation is intended (where the edges of the screen cover up some of the picture), then this is the
//  amount of signal texture scaling needed to account for that. Given an overscan value "overscanAmount" that's
//    (overscanLeft + overscanRight, overscanTop + overscanBottom)
//  this value should end up being:
//    (inputImageSize.xy - overscanAmount.xy) / inputImageSize.xy
// This is the texture coordinate offset to adjust for overscan. Because the input coordinates are [-1..1] instead
//  of [0..1], this is the offset needed to recenter the value. Given an "overscanDifference" value:
//    (overscanLeft - overscanRight, overscanTop - overscanBottom)
//  this value should be:
//    overscanDifference.xy/ inputImageSize.xy * 0.5
// The amount along each axis to apply the virtual-curved screen distortion. Usually a value in [0..1]. "0" indicates
//  no curvature (a flat screen) and "1" indicates "quite curved
// The distortion amount used for where the edges of the screen mask should be. Should be at least g_distortion, but
//  if emulating an older TV which had some additional bevel curvature that cut off part of the picture, this can be
//  applied by adding additional value to this.
// dunno what this does yet. revisit it when the mask tiling is working -HK
// The scale of the mask texture. Higher value means the coordinates are scaled more and, thus, the shadow mask is
//  smaller.
// The dimensions of the source texture (used for aspect correction
// How much to round the corners of the screen to emulate a TV with rounded corners that cut off a little picture.
//  0 indicates no rounding (squared-off corners), while a value of 1.0 means "the whole screen is an oval.
//  Values <= 0.2 are recommended.
// First thing we want to do is scale our input texture coordinate to be in [-1..1] instead of [0..1] and adjust for
// Distort these coordinates to get the -1..1 screen area:
// Calculate a separate set of distorted coordinates, this for the outer mask (which determines the masking off of extra-rounded screen
//  edges).
// Adjust for overscan
// Calculate the signed distance to the edge of the "screen" taking the rounded corners into account. This will be used to generate the
//  mask around the edges of the "screen" where we draw a dark color.
// Get our coordinate as just an "upper quadrant" coordinate, scaled to have the correct display aspect ratio.
// Get the signed distance to a rounded rectangle to get our corners.
// Use our signed distance to edge of screen along with the ddx/ddy of our mask coordinate to generate a nicely-antialiased mask where
//  0 means "fully outside of the screen" and 1 means "fully on-screen".
// Now supersample the mask texture with a mip-map bias to make it sharper. The supersampling will help counteract the bias and
//  give us a sharp mask with minimal-to-no aliasing.
// Our final texture contains the rgb value from the mask, as well as the mask value in the alpha channel.
//  Note that the color channel has not been premultiplied with the mask.
