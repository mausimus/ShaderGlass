///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// This shader combines the current frame, the previous frame, screen mask, and diffusion into the final render.
//  It's a relatively complex shader, and certainly if there are features that aren't needed for the current render it
//  could be simplified.
// $TODO: May want to do something like an ubershader version that does exactly the minimum amount of work based on how
//  many features are actually in use (pulling out the distortion or, more importantly, the sampling of the previous/
//  diffusion textures when they're unneeded).
// Do a barrel distortion to a given texture coordinate to emulate a curved CRT screen.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// This file contains all the stuff used to make these shaders compile both as GLSL and HLSL.
//
// Note that one of GLSL or HLSL must be defined.
// Decfine this to make my syntax highlighting less angry
// GLSL doesn't have separate samplers and textures, so we're using texName for everything
// A simple approximation of atan2 will suffice here, just a few terms of the taylor series are good enough for the
//  angle ranges we're dealing with.
// The original texture coordinate, intended to come straight from the full-render-target quad, in [-1..1] range (not
//  standard [0..1])
// a [horizontal, vertical] distortion pair which describes the effective curvature of the virtual screen.
// We don't want to let the distortion drop below this minimum value because at 0, the whole technique falls apart.
// $TODO: It's definitely possible to handle distortion.x or y == 0 as a special case, but I didn't do it for now.
// We're going to cast a ray from a virtual camera position p0 (0, 0, -k_distance) and collide it with a unit sphere.
//  The horizontal and vertical spread of the rays is determined by the distortion values.
// Get the squared length of the ray.
// we have an originating point p0 and a ray direction, so we can treat that as a parametric equation:
//  p = p0 + r*t
// Since we have a non-translated unit sphere (1 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2) we can sub in our parametric values and solve for
//  t as a quadratic. To simplify the math, we're going to use a slightly different form of quadratic equation:
//  t^2 - 2b*t + c == 0
// Given our "t^2 - 2b*t + c == 0" quadratic form, the quadratic formula simplifies to -b +/- sqrt(b^2 - c).
// Get the nearer of the two coordinates (and do a max inside the sqrt so we still get continuous values outside of
//  the sphere, even if they're nonsensical, they'll get masked out by our mask value anyway).
// Get our uv coordinates (Basically, latitude and longitude).
// maxUV could be calculated on the CPU and passed in for perf.
// Do the same calculation as above, but for two additional rays: the x, 0, z ray pointing all the way to the right,
//  and the 0, y, z ray pointing at the bottom (Both rays are packed into the same "diagonal" ray value, but the
//  lengths are calculated separately). This gets us the uv extents for the rays that we cast, which we can use to
//  scale our output UVs.
// Scale our UVs by the max value.
// This is the RGB current frame texture - the output of the NTSC decode shaders if decoding was needed.
// This sampler should be set up with linear texture sampling and should be set to clamp (no wrapping).
//DECLARE_TEXTURE2D(g_currentFrameTexture, g_currentFrameSampler);
// bypassing the signal generation temporarily just to get the CRT stuff working first
// This is the previous frame's texture (i.e. last frame's g_currentFrameTexture).
// This sampler should be set up with linear texture sampling and should be set to clamp (no wrapping).
//DECLARE_TEXTURE2D(g_previousFrameTexture, g_previousFrameSampler);
// This texture is the output of the GenerateScreenTexture shader, containing the (scaled, tiled, and antialiased) mask
//  texture in the rgb channels and the edge-of-screen mask value in the alpha channel. It is expected to have been
//  generated at our output resolution (i.e. it's 1:1 pixels with our output render target)
// This sampler should be set up with linear texture sampling and should be set to clamp (no wrapping).
//DECLARE_TEXTURE2D(g_screenMaskTexture, g_screenMaskSampler);
// This texture contains a tonemapped/blurred version of the input texture, to emulate the diffusion of the light from
//  the phosphors through the glass on the front of a CRT screen.
// This sampler should be set up with linear texture sampling and should be set to clamp (no wrapping).
//DECLARE_TEXTURE2D(g_diffusionTexture, g_diffusionSampler);
// This shader is intended to render a screen of the correct shape regardless of the output render target shape,
//  effectively letterboxing or pillarboxing as needed(i.e. rendering a 4:3 screen to a 16:9 render target).
//  g_viewScale is the scale value necessary to get the resulting screen scale correct. In the event the output
//  render target is wider than the intended screen, the screen needs to be scaled down horizontally to pillarbox,
//  usually like (where screenAspectRatio is crtScreenWidth / crtScreenHeight):
//    (x: (renderTargetWidth / renderTargetHeight) * (1.0 / screenAspectRatio), y: 1.0)
//  if the output render target is taller than the intended screen, it will end up letterboxed using something like:
//    (x: 1.0, y: (renderTargetHeight / renderTargetWidth) * screenAspectRatio)
// Note that if overscan (where the edges of the screen cover up some of the picture) is being emulated, it
//  potentially needs to be taken into account in this value too. See RGBToCRT.h for details if that's the case.
// If overscan emulation is intended (where the edges of the screen cover up some of the picture), then this is the
//  amount of signal texture scaling needed to account for that. Given an overscan value "overscanAmount" that's
//    (overscanLeft + overscanRight, overscanTop + overscanBottom)
//  this value should end up being:
//    (inputImageSize.xy - overscanAmount.xy) / inputImageSize.xy
// This is the texture coordinate offset to adjust for overscan. Because the input coordinates are [-1..1] instead
//  of [0..1], this is the offset needed to recenter the value. Given an "overscanDifference" value:
//    (overscanLeft - overscanRight, overscanTop - overscanBottom)
//  this value should be:
//    overscanDifference.xy/ inputImageSize.xy * 0.5
// The amount along each axis to apply the virtual-curved screen distortion. Usually a value in [0..1]. "0" indicates
//  no curvature (a flat screen) and "1" indicates "quite curved
// The RGBA color of the area around the screen.
// How much of the previous frame's brightness to keep. 0 means "we don't use the previous frame at all" and 1 means
//  "the previous  frame is at full brightness". In many CRTs, the phosphor persistence is short enough that it would
//  be effectively 0 at 50-60fps (As a CRT's phospors could potentially be completely faded out by then). However,
//  for some cases (for instance, interlaced video or for actual NES/SNES/probably other console output) it is
//  generally preferable to turn on a little bit of persistance to lessen temporal flickering on an LCD screen as it
//  can tend to look bad depending on the panel (seriously, check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA8CIY0DeS8
//  which is what my LCD panel was doing *after* the flickering interlace test truck I had had been gone for 10
//  minutes)
// How many scanlines there are in this field of the input (where a field is either the even or odd scanlines of an
//  interlaced frame, or the entirety of a progressive-scan frame)
// The strength of the separation between scanlines. 0 means "no scanline separation at all" and 1 means "separate
//  the scanlines as much as possible" - on high-enough resolution output render target (at 4k for sure) "1" means
//  "fully black between scanlines", but to reduce aliasing that amount of separation will diminish at lower output
//  resolution.
// This is the scanline-space coordinate offset to use to adjust our texture coordinate's y value based on whether
//  this is a (1-based) odd frame or an even frame. It will be 0.5 (shifting the texture up half a scanline) if it's
//  an odd frame and -0.5 (shifting the texture down half a scanline) if it's an even frame.
// Same as above, but it's the even/odd texel offset that was relevant for the previous frame (so we can blend it in
//  at the proper spot). This should match g_curEvenOddTexelOffset for a progressive-scan signal and should be
//  "-g_curEvenOddTexelOffset" if interlaced.
// This is how much diffusion to apply, blending in the diffusion texture which is an emulation of the light from the
//  screen scattering in the glass on the front of the CRT - 0 means "no diffusion" and 1 means "a whole lot of
//  diffusion".
// How much we want to blend in the mask. 0 means "mask is not visible" and 1 means "mask is fully visible
// The darkness of the darkest part of the mask. 0 means the area between the "dots" is black, 0.9 means the spaces
//  between are nearly white.
// The screen texture is 1:1 with the output render target so sample it directly off of the input texture coordinates
// Now distort the texture coordinates to get our texture into the correct space for display.
// Use "t" (before we do the even/odd update or the scanline-sharpening) to load our diffusion texture, which is an
//  approximation of the glass in front of the phosphors scattering light a little bit due to imperfections.
// Offset based on whether we're an even or odd frame
// Before we adjust the y coordinate to sharpen the scanline interpolation, grab our scanline-space y coordinate.
// Because t.y is currently in [-1, 1], this derivative multiplied by the scanline count ends up being the number of
//  total scanlines involved (including the empty ones). So this is "how much along y does one output pixel move us
//  relative to g_scanlineCount*2
// Do a little magic to sharpen up the interpolation between scanlines - a CRT (didn't really have any vertical
//  smoothing, so we want to make the centers of our texels a little more solid and do less bilinear blending
//  vertically (just a little to simulate the softness of the screen in general)
// Sample the actual display texture and add in the previous frame (For phosphor persistence)
// Reduce the influence of the scanlines as we get small enough that aliasing is unavoidable (fully fading out at
//  0.7x nyquist - early to ensure that we don't introduce any aliasing as we get too close).
// $TODO: We may want to find a way to precalculate this scanline value as a texture (like the screen texture).
//  Unfortunately the screen texture is already using all 4 of its components so we'd need a new one, which is why
//  I didn't).
// For the actual scanline value, we use the following equation:
//   cos(scanlineSpaceY * pi) * 0.5 + 0.5
//  That is, at scanline centers it's either 0 or 1. However, to avoid moir� patterns we actually want to
//  supersample it. The good news is, we can supersample over a range using numeric integration since it's a
//  sinusoid. The integration of that wave between y coordinates ya and yb ends up being:
//   (yb - ya)/2 + 1/(2pi) * (sin(pi*ya) - sin(pi*yb)))
//  but in order to turn it into an average we need to divide that result by the width of the range, which is
//  (yb - ya).
// As pixelLengthInScanlineSpace gets larger (i.e. effective output resolution gets smaller) we want to ramp up
//  the blurring dramatically to avoid moir� effects. There's no real mathematical basis for this algorithm, I
//  just eyeballed a curve until I got something that looked good at 1080p and up and introduced minimal moir�
//  (minimal meaning "it's not visible when the mask is also enabled").
// Now multiply in the scanline-spacing darkening according to the scanline strength.
// We have a different scanline parity in the previous frame so we need to offset our texture coordinate (to put
//  the prev frame's scanline center at the correct spot) and then invert our scanline multiplier (to darken the
//  alternate scanlines)
// Sample the previous texture and darken the area between scanlines accordingly.
// Blend our previous frame into the current one based on how much phosphor persistence we have between frames.
// We want to adjust the brightness to somewhat compensate for the darkening due to scanlines
// Time to put it all together: first, by applying the screen mask (i.e. the shadow mask/aperture grill, etc)...
//  $TODO: Figure out a proper scaling factor here - the 3.0 is meant to adjust for the fact that the mask cuts out
//  approximately 2/3rds of the brightness, but it's not exact, we could calculate this, I just haven't.
// ... then bringing in some diffusion on top (This isn't physically accurate (it should really be a lerp between res
//  and diffusionColor) but doing it this way preserves the brightness and still looks reasonable, especially when
//  displaying bright things on a dark background)
// Finally, mask out everything outside of the edges to get our final output value.
